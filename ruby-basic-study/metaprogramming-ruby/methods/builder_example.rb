# The core idea of Builder is simple: calls like name() and language() are processed by XmlMarkup#method_missing(), which generates an XML tag for every call.

require 'builder'
xml = Builder::XmlMarkup.new(:target=>STDOUT, :indent=>2)

xml.coder {
  xml.name 'Matsumoto', :nickname => 'Matz'
  xml.language 'Ruby'
}

xml.semester {
  xml.class 'Egyptology'
  xml.class 'Ornithology'

}

#You may be wondering whether the calls to class() clash with the inherited method class() in Object.
#They donâ€™t, because the XmlMarkup class in Builder inherits from a Blank Slate (84), which removes class( ) and most other methods from Object.
